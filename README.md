# updated-portfolio

This is an updated version of my professional portfolio. In this portfolio will not only display the information about me, contain the projects I have completed so far in this bootcamp, but it will also demonstrate how far I already have come with coding. It may not look like much now, but only about 4 months ago did I even know GitHub existed. This is going to be the portfolio I update with my most recent projects.

In the great words of a season finale of your favorite show "To be continued..."
